# Creating Pepe NFTs

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of blockchain and NFTs, Pepe, the iconic internet frog, has found its way into the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). If you're a fan of Pepe and intrigued by the idea of creating your Pepe-themed NFTs, you're in for a treat. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of generating Pepe NFTs, complete with code samples in both JavaScript and Python.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the technical aspects, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic understanding of blockchain and NFTs
- Access to a suitable blockchain development environment (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc.).
Familiarity with relevant development libraries and tools
- A collection of Pepe images or artwork for your NFTs

## Generate Pepe NFTs

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. Set up your development environment: Install Node.js and initialize a new JavaScript project

2. Install web3.js: Use npm to install the web3.js library for interacting with your chosen blockchain

3. Create your NFT contract: Write the smart contract for your Pepe NFTs. Define properties like ownership, metadata, and royalties

4. Mint your NFTs: Implement the minting process in your contract to create new Pepe NFTs

5. Interact with the blockchain: Use web3.js to interact with the blockchain, deploy your contract, and mint your Pepe NFTs

=== "JavaScript"

    ```js title="mint-nfts.js"
    const Web3 = require('web3');
    const web3 = new Web3('YOUR_ETHEREUM_PROVIDER');

    // Assuming you have a Pepe NFT contract ABI and bytecode
    const { abi, evm } = require('./PepeNFT.json');

    const deployAndMint = async () => {
    const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();

    // Deploy the Pepe NFT contract
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi);
    const deployedContract = await contract
        .deploy({ data: evm.bytecode.object })
        .send({ from: accounts[0], gas: '1000000' });

    console.log(
        'Pepe NFT Contract deployed at:',
        deployedContract.options.address
    );

    // Mint a new Pepe NFT
    const tokenId = 1; // The unique identifier for the Pepe NFT
    const recipient = accounts[0]; // The owner of the NFT
    await deployedContract.methods
        .mintPepeNFT(tokenId, recipient)
        .send({ from: accounts[0] });

    console.log('Pepe NFT with ID', tokenId, 'minted for', recipient);
    };

    deployAndMint();
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```py title="mint-nfts.py"
    from web3 import Web3
    from web3.contract import Contract

    # Connect to the Ethereum network
    w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("YOUR_ETHEREUM_PROVIDER"))

    # Load the ABI and bytecode from your Pepe NFT contract
    with open("PepeNFT.json") as json_file:
        contract_data = json.load(json_file)

    contract = w3.eth.contract(abi=contract_data["abi"], bytecode=contract_data["bytecode"])

    # Deploy the Pepe NFT contract
    tx_hash = contract.constructor().transact({"from": w3.eth.accounts[0], "gas": 2000000})

    tx_receipt = w3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)

    contract_address = tx_receipt.contractAddress

    print("Pepe NFT Contract deployed at:", contract_address)

    # Mint a new Pepe NFT
    token_id = 1
    recipient = w3.eth.accounts[0]

    tx_hash = contract.functions.mintPepeNFT(token_id, recipient).transact(
        {"from": w3.eth.accounts[0]}
    )

    w3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)

    print(f"Pepe NFT with ID {token_id} minted for {recipient}")
    ```
